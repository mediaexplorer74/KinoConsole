# KinoConsole 

KinoConsole for WP 8.1 R.E. / RnD

## About the original
KinoConsole is the (a) famous "Video Screen streaming service". 
Sadly, its W10M developing stopped... No new features. I am interesting in KinoConsole tech. :)

## My 2 cents
- Appx Decomp.
- Fast code/architecture research
- WP8 -> W10M code "rebase" ("refactor.") - 5 % only  

## Result
- Draft / Damaged
- No more time finish this work... but I'm still trying to complete my hard way ))
