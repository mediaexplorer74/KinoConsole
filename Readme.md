# KinoConsole 

KinoConsole for WP 8.1 R.E. / RnD

## About the original
KinoConsole is the (a) famous "Video Screen streaming service". 
Sadly, its W10M developing stopped... No new features. I am interesting in KinoConsole tech. :)

## My 2 cents
- Appx Decomp.
- Fast code/architecture research
- WP8 -> W10M code "rebase" ("refactor.") - 5 % ready  

## Result
- Draft / Not ported / Build failed
- I haven't so much time... but I'm still trying to complete my strange "KinoConsole reburn" idea :)
